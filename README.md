# Project--Hadoop-36

**In this project We will use MapReduce with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here we will build find Most Popular Movie by taking into consideration how many times that movie has occured.** <br></br> We will recommend similar movies based on score and numPairs i.e that is no. of different users rated these movies where score and numPairs will be calculated using cosine similarity.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand MapReduce First**...<br></br>

**What is MapReduce?** <br></br>

MapReduce is a programming paradigm that enables massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. As the processing component, MapReduce is the heart of Apache Hadoop. The term "MapReduce" refers to two separate and distinct tasks that Hadoop programs perform.
A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting, and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation.


**Important Note: Go through the u.data and u.item files before jumping to the code.**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section üòÅüòÇ. Thanks!**
